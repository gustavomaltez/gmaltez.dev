# Exploring React Hooks

React hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows us to use state and other React features in functional components. In this blog post, we will explore some commonly used React hooks and see how they can simplify our code.

## useState

The `useState` hook is used to manage state in a functional component. Here's an example of how to use `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```
