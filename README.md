## 📝 About

This is my personal blog made with a couple of pretty awesome tools like 
[fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), [preact](https://preactjs.com/), 
[twind](https://twind.dev/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), 
[deno](https://deno.land/) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 
I created this project because I really wanted to have a place to share my thoughts 
about things that I'm learning and also to share some of my projects. I hope you 
enjoy it! I also wanted to build a project from zero to production using deno, 
so I decided to use it to build this blog.

## 🛠 Stack

- [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) - An awesome web framework that runs on top of deno
- [preact](https://preactjs.com/) - A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API
- [twind](https://twind.dev/) - The smallest, fastest, most feature complete Tailwind-in-JS solution in existence
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- [deno](https://deno.land/) - An awesome runtime for javascript and typescript with a lot of cool features
- [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A collection of services provided by google to help you build and grow your app
