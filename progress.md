#### Yes, this is how I'm going to track my progress on this project 😉

#### "The set-in-stone board"
- Focus on one thing at a time. 
- Everything needs to be done at the utmost quality.
- Utmost quality doesn't mean perfection.
- Nothing is a priority if everything is a priority
- If you can't do it right now, you can't do it at all.

## 🚧 In progress (only one task at time)
- Create models (user, post, comment, etc)

## 🗃️ Backlog (max 10 items)
1. Refactor database to use models
2. (EPIC) Comment system
   
## 📝 Done
