#### Yes, this is how I'm going to track my progress on this project üòâ

#### The "set-in-stone" board
- Focus on one thing at a time. 
- Everything needs to be done at the utmost quality.
- Utmost quality doesn't mean perfection.
- Nothing is a priority if everything is a priority
- If you can't do it right now, you can't do it at all.
